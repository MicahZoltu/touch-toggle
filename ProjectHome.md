This is a very simple system tray application that will toggle the touch setting on/off on Windows 7 computers with a touch screen.

When launched, a system tray icon will appear and clicking/tapping/touching it will toggle the touch sensor on/off.  For computers that support a pen and touch at the same time, this will only toggle the touch part so your pen will still work.

Right-click/long-touch to bring up a context menu which will let you exit the application.
